# Setting Up a Node.js Project

This guide will walk you through the steps to set up a new Node.js project.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (which includes npm, the Node Package Manager)

## Steps to Set Up a Node.js Project

### Step 1: Create a Project Directory

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the location where you want to create your project.
3. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

   ```
   mkdir my-node-project
   cd my-node-project
   ```
### Step 2: Initialize the Project
```
npm init
```
To skip the prompts and create a default package.json, you can use:
```
npm init -y
```

### Step 3: Create the Main File
Create a main file for your application. By default, this is often named index.js. You can create it using the following command:
```
touch index.js
```

Open index.js in your favorite text editor and add a simple example code:

```javascript
// index.js
console.log('Hello, Node.js!');
```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
```
npm install express
```
This command will:
Download and install the Express library.
Update your package.json file to include Express as a dependency.
Create a node_modules directory in your project to store the installed packages.

### Step 5: Run Your Application
To run your Node.js application
```
node index.js
```
You should see the output:
```
Hello, Node.js!
```
